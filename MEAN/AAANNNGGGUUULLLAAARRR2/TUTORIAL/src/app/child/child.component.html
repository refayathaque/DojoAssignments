<p>  I am the child component! <em>(You can tell because I have a border around me)</em></p>

<p>app.component.html is LOADING me using my SELECTOR, which can be found in my component.ts file. My SELECTOR is used as a TAG here to have me sucessfully integrated in the AppComponent!</p>

<p>I will also be LOADING my child (our granchild component) below!</p>

<div [ngStyle]="{'border':'1px solid #8CBF10'}">
    <app-grandchild></app-grandchild>
</div>
