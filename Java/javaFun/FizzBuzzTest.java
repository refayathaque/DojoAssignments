// Arrays in Java are fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type with a zero-based index. This means that accessing and setting elements is done by an integer where 0 represents the first item, and so on

// Note: In Java an array has a fixed size (after initialization), meaning that you can't add or remove items from an array. In the example above, we declared that this array will contain  5 items. You can't decrease or increase the number of items in this array after initialization
